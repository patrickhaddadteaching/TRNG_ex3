* How the jitter variance and the number of xored oscillator impact the throughput of a MO-TRNG whose Shannon entropy value have to be higher than 0.997 ? 
  - For a given number of xored oscillators, lower the jitter variance is, lower is the throughput of a MO-TRNG whose Shannon entropy value is higher than 0.997.
  - For a given jitter variance, lower the number of xored oscillators is, lower is the throughput of a MO-TRNG whose Shannon entropy value is higher than 0.997.
